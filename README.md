# Single qubit error mitigation by simulating non-markovian dynamics on IBM Quantum device

The evolution of system dynamics is described by the Lindblad equation. In order to recover the system state, the time-reversed Lindlad equation (which is not necessarily CP) can be used. Further, the non-CP map, can be deomposed into a convex combination of CPTP maps. These can be simulated on the quantum device, to recover the system state.
