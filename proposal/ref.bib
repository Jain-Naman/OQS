	title={Unraveling-paired dynamical maps can recover the input of quantum channels},
	abstract={We explore algebraic and dynamical consequences of unraveling general time-local master equations. We show that the "influence martingale", the paramount ingredient of a recently discovered unraveling framework, pairs any time-local master equation with a one parameter family of Lindblad-Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan master equations. At any instant of time, the variance of the influence martingale provides an upper bound on the Hilbert-Schmidt distance between solutions of paired master equations. Finding the lowest upper bound on the variance of the influence martingale yields an explicit criterion of "optimal pairing". The criterion independently retrieves the measure of isotropic noise necessary for the structural physical approximation of the flow the time-local master equation with a completely positive flow. The optimal pairing also allows us to invoke a general result on linear maps on operators (the "commutant representation") to embed the flow of a general master equation in the off-diagonal corner of a completely positive map which in turn solves a time-local master equation that we explicitly determine. We use the embedding to reverse a completely positive evolution, a quantum channel, to its initial condition thereby providing a protocol to preserve quantum memory against decoherence. We thus arrive at a model of continuous time error correction by a quantum channel.}

	title={Single Qubit Error Mitigation by Simulating Non-Markovian Dynamics},
	abstract={Quantum simulation is a powerful tool to study the properties of quantum systems. The dynamics of open quantum systems are often described by Completely Positive (CP) maps, for which several quantum simulation schemes exist. We present a simulation scheme for open qubit dynamics described by a larger class of maps: the general dynamical maps which are linear, hermitian preserving and trace preserving but not necessarily positivity preserving. The latter suggests an underlying system-reservoir model where both are entangled and thus non-Markovian qubit dynamics. Such maps also come about as the inverse of CP maps. We illustrate our simulation scheme on an IBM quantum processor by showing that we can recover the initial state of a Lindblad evolution. This paves the way for a novel form of quantum error mitigation. Our scheme only requires one ancilla qubit as an overhead and a small number of one and two qubit gates.}
